# FFXIVPosition
Simple FFXIV Position Tool for Explorers

This tool simply captures the player's current position in memory and allows you to "nudge" yourself in a direction at a given increment. You will need to snag memory.dll from nuget on this one.

# WARNING

Thanks https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll for the memory library.
